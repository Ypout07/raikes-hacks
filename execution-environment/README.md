# Example Repos

## What are these?

### Student dummy repo:
- This is a obfuscated repo prepared to be seen by students. It is smaller, has no business logic, and a different structure. 
- In production, this would be done systematically using Abstract Search Trees; however, for simplicity, we created this repo ourselves instead of providing the company our tool to simplify it. 
- Contains some of the bugs that are in the company product, but not all. This is mainly a chance for students to test if their Docker image works on a codebase and if it can catch basic errors. 

### Private company:
- This repo contains the real business logic that will NOT be passed onto the student nor our service. 
- It is what the company will run each agent on using the tool in the `cli` package, returning us metrics. 
- It's larger, more complex, and has more errors.
