# Template

## What is this?

- This is a template that users will be able to download through the website. It implements the Creevo agent tooling and provides boilerplate for users. 
- Inside, students have control over implementing subagents, defining the system prompt, adding extra tooling for the agents, and anything else that they want!
- The provided Dockerfile lets users upload to Docker Hub and pass the tag onto our system for their submission.
